## My process

### Built with

- Basic HTML5
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- DOM events handling with JavaScript

### What I learned

After this challenge I recap what I learned with basic HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Besides, I figured out what I need to do with a project given: what is the requirements and how to build as close as possible to the project.

### Continued development

Even though I have learned up to React.js, Next.js and Node.js,... but I will keep on practicing the basics until fluently building web applications.

### Useful resources

- [Mozilla Developer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This helped me for remember the use of JavaScript functions and properties.
- [W3 School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing article which helped me understand more about HTML and CSS, also JavaScript too.
